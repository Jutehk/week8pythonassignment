--- Initial Findings and Observations ---
Based on the initial analysis of the Air Quality dataset:
- The dataset contains hourly readings of various air pollutants and meteorological conditions.
- Missing values are represented by -200.0 and have been replaced with NaN and then imputed using the mean of each column.
- The average monthly Carbon Monoxide (CO) levels show variations throughout the year.
- The average temperature appears to differ across the days of the week.
- The line chart shows the trend of CO concentration over the time period of the dataset.
- The scatter plot provides a visual indication of the relationship (or lack thereof) between temperature and relative humidity.
